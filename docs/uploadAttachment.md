# UploadAttachment

[Official API](https://developers.pipefy.com/v1.0/docs/how-to-upload-attachments-and-attach-to-a-card-record)  
[Implemented Class](../Capgemini.Pipefy/Attachment/UploadAttachment.cs)

Uploads an attachment to Pipefy.

> **Important!** This activity just uploads the file and doesn't attaches it to any object. To attach it, check the guides on updating [Cards](updateCardField.md) and [TableRecord](setTableRecordFieldValue.md) fields.

## Arguments

### &lt;In&gt; OrganizationID : long

ID of the Organization to place the file.

You can find this info from the API or from the link when accessing it through the web.

### &lt;In&gt; FileInfo : FileInfo

FileInfo of the file to be uploaded.

> You can't fill FileInfo and FilePath at the same time.

### &lt;In&gt; FilePath : string

Path of the file to be uploaded.

> You can't fill FileInfo and FilePath at the same time.

### &lt;Out&gt; FileUrl : string

Private URL of the uploaded file.

> **Important!** This is a single string, but when setting fields in either TableRecords or Cards, the attachment type receives multiple items, so you need to place this string inside a string array.

The timeout limit (in ms) for the request to be completed.
